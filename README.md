# image_classifyhackathon
  Image classification is a fascinating deep learning project and In this project, we will build a convolution neural network with Keras with python. The aim of the project is to classify between good oranges and the oranges that has defect .

Using the images given to the training and the validation dataset our model will predict out if the given oranges are good or has  a defect. This is a small use of this classification but the amazing part is that we can actually use this in various fields where classification is not easily possible by humans.
